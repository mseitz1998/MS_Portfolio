        This is the first full, usable application I made during my time in 
        COMP 2161 at Thompson Rivers University.

        This store does not process actual 
        orders or payment, and instead is a simulaiton of a store. The user accounts and orders are stored in the database and presented as if they 
        are real, but the orders do not process any real payment and are intended to be representations of orders rather than real orders.
