MS_Portfolio - See it live on mseitz.dev!

Created by Mitchell Seitz, May 2024

This is the source code for my developer portfolio website, programmed 
using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please see the bottom of this 
readme for borrowed code sources.

Notes, by topic:

Remember to check chrome, firefox, safari, and edge on macos / windows / 
ios / android / ubuntu after major changes.

Background Behavior: 
   - When changing background particle behavior, please edit 
     MS_Portfolio/res/particles/app.js 
   - MS_Portfolio/res/particles/particles.js has the default values. 
   - Clear browser cache and hit refresh.
_______________________________________________________________________

Issues: 

- Firefox on ubuntu reders differently than firefox on other browsers. 
  Particles.js background animation is faster, cause unknown.

Borrowed Code

Big thanks to the following sources that helped me make this project

Vincent Garreau, Particles.js: 

   https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js

   This is the library I used to make the background for the website, 
   and you can find the files in res/particles. I modified them as 
   needed to suit the needs of this website.
