MS_Portfolio

Created by Mitchell Seitz, May 2024

This is the source code for my developer portfolio website, programmed 
using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Big thanks to the following sources that helped me make this project:

Vincent Garreau, Particles.js: 

   https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js

   This is the library I used to make the background for the website, 
   and you can find the files in res/particles. I modified them as 
   needed to suit the needs of this website. 

w3 Schools, where I learned how to make the Menu system:

   2: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown_sidenav.asp

Notes, by topic:

When changing background particle behavior, please edit 

MS_Portfolio/res/particles/app.js, particles.js has the default values.
