            My name is Mitchell Seitz, and I'm a third-year Comp Sci student at Thompson Rivers University.
            I've also run a small business as a handyman, worked a variety of jobs, and helped start 
            and run a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising support for youth in and 
            from the foster care system. My journey to this point has been fairly unique, so I might as well tell you 
            a bit about myself so you can understand how I got here. 
            <br><br> 
            During High School, I ended up homeless and then in the 
            foster care system. In order to stay in school during this time, I switched to a 
            school that only had space available in a trades co-op program. It was here I learned the skills 
            that kept me going throughout young adulthood, and spent most of my time on a construction site or landscaping.
            I graduated at 17, and at 18 I registered for a business license and began working 
            as a handyman in my spare time to get extra money to support myself. I also worked service jobs, landscaping, 
            demolition, construction, property maintenance, and other jobs to make ends meet. 
            <br><br>
            While doing all of that, I still found myself curious, and started spending my spare time learning anything 
            I could find. I started by 
            bringing home university textbooks abandoned by students in the apartment buildings I worked in for one of my 
            jobs, and later on started buying them at value village. I started learning Math from 
            books in the break room at a grocery store I worked at, solving brilliant.org problems 
            on the bus, or using the wolfram problem generators to test myself. I learned some python, started messing around
            with Arduino and Raspbery Pi, dabbled a bit in foreign languages, and started practicing doing math in my head. 
            <br><br>
            At some point, I felt like I had caught up on learning I didn't really get a chance to do in High School, and when I 
            was 19 I decided I wanted to pursue an University Education. However, although I learned as much as I could, 
            <br><br>
