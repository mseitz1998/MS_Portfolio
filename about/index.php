        <p class="paragraphStandard">

            My name is Mitchell Seitz, and I'm a third-year Comp Sci student at Thompson Rivers University.
            I've been studying online for my University education, and so I guess I consider myself 
            a self-taught developer as well. I've also worked for years as a handyman and helped start 
            and run a nonprofit dedicated to raising support for youth in and 
            from the foster care system. My journey to this point has been fairly unique, so I might as well tell you 
            a bit about myself so you can understand how I got here. 
            <br><br> 
            During High School, I ended up homeless and then in the 
            foster care system. In order to stay in school during this time, I switched to a 
            school that only had space available in a trades co-op program. It was here I learned the skills 
            that kept me going throughout young adulthood.
            I graduated at 17, and at 18 I registered a business and began working 
            as a handyman to support myself. I also worked service jobs, landscaping, 
            demolition, construction, property maintenance, and other jobs to make ends meet. 
            <br><br>
            After high school, I still found myself curious, and started spending my spare time learning anything 
            I could find. I started by 
            bringing home university textbooks left by graduates in some apartment buildings I worked in.
            I was interested in a variety of things, like math, neuroscience, 
            and human biology. Later, my curiosity took a more technical focus, and 
            I started doing brilliant.org 
            problems on the bus, using the wolfram problem generators to test myself, spent breaks at 
            work reading some of the textbooks I found and practicing math I didn't learn in school. 
            I also learned some python, 
            started messing around with an arduino and raspberry pi, and dabbled in languages. 
            <br><br>
            At some point, I felt like I had caught up on learning I didn't really get a chance to do in High School, and when I 
            was 19 I decided I wanted to pursue university education. I enrolled with Athabasca 
            University, which has open admission for online courses. Because AU courses transfer well to pretty much any 
            university in Canada, I took this route to avoid having to do high school pre-requisites and get some uni done.
            After a few courses, I realized that I was most interested in computer science and decided 
            to pursue this path. I completed twelve courses with a 3.71/4.00 GPA,
            including courses covering Data Structures & Algorithms, Calculus, Stats, 
            Programming in Java, C++, Web Development and a few others.

            Unfortunately, studying online is kind of boring. Fortunately, I had friends to keep me compnay during this time, 
            including some amazing people who I met in the foster care system as a teenager. When we reconnected,
            it turned out a few of us had the same idea. We imagined a organization, created and led by youth with lived 
            experience in the foster care system, to advocate for and provide support for young people in and from care.

            One of those people was Chanice McAnuff, and she took on the commitment and responsibility 
            of leading the organization, and I was happy to work with her to find ways to make our 
            goals work as a co-founder. 
            During 2020, we started meeting on zoom and over the phone to 
            form the basis for what the organization would look like. At some point, we started to meet in person, 
            setting up AV equipment and getting ready to record media to bring attention to our cause.
