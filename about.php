            My name is Mitchell Seitz, and I'm a cross between a self-taught developer and a computer science 
            student. I'm in my Third year of my Bachelors of Computing Science at TRU, and have been studying online 
            for my entire university education. I chose to study online so I could juggle school, work, and activism,
            alongside other things. As a result, I've been learning on my own, and as of right now I'm focusing on 
            finishing school and showcasing my personal projects. This portfolio is the result of that, and I look forward to 
            taking this time to get nearer to the end of my degree, exploring projects I find personally exciting, and 
            getting ready to enter the workforce.
